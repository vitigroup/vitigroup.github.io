        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University. My main focus is to investigate the chemical content and the physical properties of nearby galaxies, in pqrticular NGC1068 and NGC253, by targeting various species. In particular, I have a soft spot for carbon chains. I mainly use ALMA observations coupled with chemical models.</p>
        <p> I have interest in both extra-galactic and galactic domain, where I come from. During my PhD thesis, I used millimetre and centimetre interferometric observation (ALMA, NOEMA, VLA) of molecular species to study the chemical content of low-mass protostars located in Orion, considered as the closest and best analogue to the Sun’s birth environment.</p>

She focuses on the modeling of shock chemistry, which can help predict and analyze extragalactic astrochemical observations of shocked regions. She is especially interested in fine-tuning our predictions for dust-related species. Besides, Kasia is interested in observations of molecules in nearby and high-z galaxies.</p>
        <p> In her previous projects, Kasia worked on combining observations with modeling to study star formation and chemistry of the Galactic and extragalactic star-forming regions. She developed her own modeling tool, the so-called galaxy-in-a-box model, which predicts molecular emission arising from active and current star formation in galaxies.</p>

        <h2> Bin Jia </h2>
        <p>I’m a PhD candidate at Leiden Observatory under the supervision of Serena. My research primarily focuses on molecules in extragalactic environments, particularly in galaxies like NGC 1068. I’m interested in understanding how molecules form and are destroyed under different conditions, and I investigate the physical properties they trace, such as temperature and gas density, using ALMA observations. Additionally, I enjoy using UCLCHEM to explore the origins of the molecules we observe.</p> 
	<p>I received my BSc from the University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, and my MSc from Leiden University. During my time in the US, I had a wonderful experience researching in biophysics, and my first master's project, under Nienke van der Marel, focused on protoplanetary disks.</p>

        <h2> Yichen Sun </h2>
        <p>I am studying the C, N, and O isotopic abundance ratios in molecular clouds on the Galactic metal-poor outer disk. This includes observing molecular tracers to derive these ratios and examining the assumptions behind current methods. I am also working on astrochemical models at galactic scales, considering variations in C, N, and O abundances due to galactic chemical evolution. My current research interests include the chemistry of oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing compounds in galactic environments with different C/N/O ratios, as well as the non-LTE effects on hyperfine structure transitions of molecular species. In addition to my astronomy research, I enjoy identifying constellations by eye and am interested in geography, biology, and history.</p>
